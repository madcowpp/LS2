When you check out the project from a git repository, you have to build
all autoconf files. This may be done by executing the script

autogen.sh

From now on, you can execute

./configure && make && sudo make install

to build and install the lateration shooter.

More information on compiling and running the shooter can be found in
the file README.

When you add an algorithm or an error model, you have to add its source
files to src/Makefile.am and rebuild.
